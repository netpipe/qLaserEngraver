# qLaserEngraver
gcode generator for laser engravers

https://netpipe.ca/?page_id=305  this is for linuxcnc version , it was already working great using the graster setup and having its own threads for setting pwm so it can be super fast


porting the python folder to qt should be able to run on arduino's


gcode.py im not sure weather to put the spindle speed or pwm speed before or after in cut function  so you may need to play with it
